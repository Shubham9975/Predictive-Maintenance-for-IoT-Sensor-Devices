# 🧠 Machine Learning Internship Task
**Project Title:** Predictive Maintenance for IoT Sensor Devices  
**Duration:** 1–2 days (flexible)

---

## 📘 Background
You are tasked with analyzing sensor data collected from a fleet of industrial IoT devices to predict equipment failures. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can forecast whether a device is likely to fail within the next 24 hours.

This is a real-world-style, end-to-end ML problem involving:
- Structured tabular data
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Explainability

The data is synthetic and has embedded failure patterns that simulate real industrial behavior (e.g., voltage drift, vibration increase, signal drops).

## 📁 Files Included
| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `train.csv` | Training dataset with labeled failure data |
| `test.csv` | Unseen test dataset for evaluation |
| `README` | Task instructions (this file) |

---

## ✅ Your Task

1. **Understand the Data**
   - Perform EDA on the training set.
   - Identify key features influencing equipment failures.

2. **Build Predictive Models**
   - Train at least two classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
   - Evaluate your models using:
     - Precision / Recall / F1-Score
     - Confusion matrix
     - ROC AUC (optional)

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Suggest or apply additional features (e.g., rolling averages, drift indicators).
   - Highlight any that improved model performance.

4. **Interpretability**
   - Use SHAP or similar tools to explain your model’s decisions.
   - Discuss the top contributing features to failures.

5. **Final Evaluation**
   - Use `test.csv` to evaluate your final model.
   - Share metrics and insights about how well your model generalizes.

---

## 💡 Bonus (Optional)
- Propose how you’d deploy this model in a real-time monitoring system.
- Suggest alert thresholds or risk scores.
- Apply basic time-series smoothing, if appropriate.
